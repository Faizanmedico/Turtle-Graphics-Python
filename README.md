Turtle Graphics Python

Python's ‘turtle’ module lets you create fun drawings and patterns. It’s like having a small turtle that moves around the screen, drawing lines as it goes, just like the short snake game we used to play when we were kids! Now you can control your turtle’s movements and create multiple shapes accordingly.
